# Resume_Extractor

With the use of natural language processing (NLP) methods, this project intends to develop an automatic PDF extractor and job matching system for resumes (CVs). Data collection is the first step, which entails obtaining job descriptions from the Hugging Face dataset and resumes in PDF format. The fundamental procedure entails PDF parsing to extract text, preprocessing to tidy up and organize the data, and named entity recognition (NER) to extract pertinent information from resumes, such as names, contact information, talents, education, and job experience. The captured text is transformed into numerical vectors using text vectorization methods like TF-IDF. The similarity ratings between resumes and job descriptions are determined by a matching algorithm. These ratings are used to rate resumes.

  The system has a threshold for evaluating if a CV corresponds to a job description, and it produces a ranked list of the best applicants for each position. Measurement measures for evaluation, such as recall and accuracy, assess system performance. Because of the project's adaptability, many NLP models, text vectorization techniques, and matching algorithms may be tested and improved. Transparency and repeatability are guaranteed through documentation. In the end, this project automates the matching of candidates with job criteria, streamlining the hiring process.
